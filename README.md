# testing-my-skills
just to publish few of my little scripts and programs i created during my python tutorials.

First three files were created during my first subject at college and were oriented more about understanding and scripting using python 2.7 with ArcGIS.
Second semester focuses more on basic programming and simple math in GIS technologies. We used python 3.4 there. 
After that during my summer i ended up looking for some more challanges to improve myself.
